<p>Turns out our heroic party was foolish to trust the shady rogue Isabella. After a long days march the exausted party set up camp on a small hill. As everyone drifted off to sleep Isabella sprung into action. The evil rouge has struck a deal with your currupt uncle who seeks to be rid of you so he can rule the kingdom as a vassal of the Shadowlands. </p>

<p>Isabella sprung up and viciously stabbed Sir Aldric in the neck, killing him almost instantly in his sleep. Her fear of Willow's magic, who was sleeping in your tent is probably the only thing that saved Evelyn's life. Isabella already got her payment so she didnt really care. She made off with a few more trinkets and was gone and nowhere to be found. Nothing can be done now exept to mourn the loss of a true friend and to carry on with our grim duty.</p>
